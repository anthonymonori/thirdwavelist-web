    <span className="firstLetter">I.</span> We are focused on the enthusiast! We don't care about the mainstream consumer. We want to build the tool enthusiasts can use to explore excellent coffee, anywhere.
    <br /><br />
    <span className="firstLetter">II.</span> We are here for the long run! We aim to build the most comprehensive database for Third Wave Coffee. It is going to take time, but we don't mind.
    <br /><br />
    <span className="firstLetter">III.</span> We build for use, not addiction. We don't fancy random notifications. We want you to use our tool when it is relevant for you. If you forget about us, we believe it is because you have better things to do.
    <br /><br />
    <span className="firstLetter">IV.</span> We build for the world we want to live in! Therefore we do no tracking nor would ever sell your data. If we decide to run ads or work with any partner we'll be transparent and frank about this.
    <br /><br />
    <span className="firstLetter">V.</span> We are easy to reach! If you have questions or want to get involved, just hit us a message.
